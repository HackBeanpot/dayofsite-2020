            These challenges were inspired by this yearâ€™s theme, Sprout. We hope
            that during your time at HackBeanpot you will help us embody the
            sprout theme by building new relationships, trying new things, and
            helping us be sustainable. The following are two challenges based on
            our Sprout track that you can use as inspiration for your projects.

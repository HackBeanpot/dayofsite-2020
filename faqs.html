            <h5>How can I find and join a team?</h5>
            <p>
              We’ll be holding a team formation activity at the beginning of the hackathon on Friday, right after the opening ceremony where you can meet potential teammates. After that, you are still welcome to join or leave a team at any time.

          <h5>I’m stuck- how can I get help with my project?</h5>
          <p>You can see which mentors are currently available <a href="https://live.hackbeanpot.com/mentors">here</a>, and reach out to one on Slack via the #mentor-help channel! If you need some inspiration, check out our <a href="https://projects.hackbeanpot.com/">past projects</a>!</p>

          <h5>I have a food allergy. What should I do?</h5>
          <p>
            If you made note of your dietary restrictions on the confirmation page of the
            application portal, we’ll be sure to accommodate your needs! All food served
            will be labeled with allergen information, but if you have any questions ask an organizer.

            Catch one of us walking around - we’re wearing the navy shirts! Be sure you’ve
            joined our <a href="http://tiny.cc/HBP20">Slack workspace</a>. We’ll be using it to make important announcements throughout the event.

          <h5>Why should I go to a workshop/talk?</h5>
          <p>
            Some of the best parts of a hackathon is how much you’re able to learn and new people you’ll get to meet and connections you can make. Attending a workshop is a great way to do both those things, plus you’ll get a chance to take a step back from your project and breathe a little. (And you’ll get raffle tickets for attending too.) Tired of coding and tech? We also have non-technical activities planned!

        <div class="grid-item faq-container">
          <h5>My brain is fried. What can I do to relax a bit?</h5>
          <p>
            Attend a talk or activity! Go to a talk or sponsored event! Grab a snack and hydrate with your reusable bottle! The options are endless.

          <h5>Can I leave and come back?</h5>
          <p>
            Yes! We encourage you to get some sleep at home and come back refreshed.

          <h5>Got any tips for presenting and talking to judges?</h5>
          <p>
            HackBeanpot is all about learning! We want to hear about your process - the
            successes as well as the challenges you’ve faced along the way. What features
            are you most proud of? What updates or additions would you make in the future?
            Did you have to step out of your comfort zone or try something new? <a href="http://tiny.cc/HBPresources">Read more</a>

          <h5>What should I do if my project isn't done?</h5>
          <p>
            It’s totally okay if your project isn’t complete! After all, you only had a
            day and a half. You should still submit your project -- judges will take into
            account your process. You can demo as much of it as you have and talk about
            what you would add in the future too.

          <h5>Where can I sleep?</h5>
          <p>
            We recommend that you get some sleep at home, but you’ll be able to rest in the any of the areas that are open to hacking on the <a href="https://live.hackbeanpot.com/maps.html">map</a>. Remember to bring your own pillow and blanket.
